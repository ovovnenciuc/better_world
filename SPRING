The soft rustle of the forest accompanies me,
Wandering the hidden paths of nature,
Enigmatic words the spring whispers to me
To understand the timid voice of the drop.

The white dandelion fluff carols the sky,
Fulfilling the wishes of strange children,
When I wander through the fragrant plain
I feel protected from the great oak forest.

When bees through the small flowers waltz of harmony
Detached from a ballet, he interprets it delicately
I sway to the chords of the song,
The soul discovering the enchanted realm.

When the light flutters on your gentle face
In a symphony of colors they appear,
A trembling of happiness, admiring their game,
I'm excited to please you.

When the bat smells the fragrant flowers
Amethyst twinkles around without restlessly jumping,
The passionate scent exalts our timid temptations,
Gently touching your high forehead.

When the wind carries the limp creature in its dance,
Sparks of color appear shining.
Emerald nostalgia, the enchanted forest,
The heart trembles in the vastness of the night.

When the cherry shook its white petals
Leaving around an atmosphere of a myth
In the evening light I hide in your dreams
Watching you fall asleep.

The plain full of poppies always delights me,
The vibrations of the crickets in the air sounded slowly,
Messed up in the thoughts that trouble me,
 I don't want to regret meeting you.
